# friend-list

During covid, it is always nice to have some friends.
This will randomly generate a list of friends for you to scroll through, but more importantly, to remove them from your list and even fetch for some new ones ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‚.

Seriously though, the goal with this project was to make a simple vue 2 app that felt like an app when you "Add To Homescreen" on your phone. Although I didn't give it an icon, I did add some metatags to the head that disable zooming and scaling so that it doesn't feel like a "web" page. 

Anything else, such as the fetching, menu, and some of the css glass look was just a bit of fun and practice.
